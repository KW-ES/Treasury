95% of positions currently come from Murex, with the remaining 5% from other systems
Non-Murex positions include: IBD trades (managed in ACPS)
Physical commodities (from Osiris)
Corporate bank trades (loans and deposits)
Operational call deposits and finance adjustments (from Smart/Chameleon) Current risk runs are designed by entity sets (e.g., SA entity set) Position state gets imported into Murex
Market value component is used in attribution process
Cash balance comes from Smart/Chameleon
Current attribution process: For position states imported from external systems: Market Value + Cash Balance
For Murex positions: Market Value from Murex + Pass-Cache from Chameleon Including pass-cache in all runs would require splitting existing runs
This could potentially require: Adding ~90 new tasks in controlling (for SA only)
Creating ~90 new merge tasks to recombine outputs
Reconsidering the entity-set-based design Different system combinations present unique challenges: Osiris positions present special challenges as cash in those portfolios is part of scope
For IBD and Corporate Bank positions, both market value and cash balance come from external systems Create one run with two logical sources to handle different position types
Alternative approach: Import position sets, generate pass-cash balances from Murex, compare with Chameleon's cash balance, import the difference as corrective position, then run everything including pass-cache
This alternative might avoid splitting runs but requires careful implementation and testing Meeting leader to share notes and put details in an email Continue refining approach before the upcoming design session for RISC Investigate if the Osiris physical commodity positions are in the same portfolio as their derivatives
NotesTranscriptYes.Hey everyone.Good, good. Let me know when you can see my screen, yeah?Sorry, I just lost my meeting notes, so that's just great.You can see my screen, yeah?Okay. Yeah, I think myself and Bilal just had a chat just before this meeting to align. I guess we're not going to solve any of the problems today. It's just to frame the problem. So that, you know, when the design session comes, that you guys are ready for the type of questions that the users will have, while at the same time, we also think about this problem, because Bilal, I think he had a session with them last week, and they require a lot of allergic reactions toTo some of the, like, I guess, some of the things we're planning on doing. So, it's just to give you the heads up and to for you to, you know, to. And potentially starting here about some solutions, right? I mean, I think you guys, I don't know, Antony, are you in the risk stream? Are you the person who's going to be on the risk stream on the funding project?Okay. Are you familiar with RMP setup or how position sets, et cetera? I just, people have briefed you.Okay, great. So, I guess, yeah, so what we've tried to do is we've tried to set up the background for you, like, so you have a just reiterate the point where we're going to be. Actually, where we are currently, in terms of like the risk grants that we have in Murex, we have 95% of the positions coming from Murex now.I think there's one or two things that will be going live now, between now and then, related to the, what is that project again? Structures. The structuring project, but that's going to be like, I think that will be done by the time funding in any case is live. So that is the one state. So this is one thing to.And then the other 5% would be positions that will never live in Murex for one reason or another, because they are either different business divisions or that Murex doesn't have the functionality for them, right? So to focus on that set of traits, we have these IBD set of traits. These things are managed in a system called ACPS and they will always be in ACPS because that's a different division and that's how they run their business, right?Then we have the physical commodities that come from Osiris. I understand Murex doesn't support the product set in the way the business wants, right Bilal? That's why we're keeping them in this system.Yeah.Thank you for watching!Yeah, and I think one thing we said was something for us to check. They might be in the same portfolio as their derivatives, right, Bilal? i.e. the position state lives in the same portfolio as things. So this is something we need to check and hence why I have it as an open point, right?Then we have corporate bank traits, loans and depos. These ones, they will, yeah, they, like it's a different business unit that will not be in Murex. But they have their own portfolio note. It might give us some vision regarding the design, so that's why I've just highlighted it here. Then, there are traits that come from smart or chameleon, right?These set of traits, there's these operational call deposits, and then we have these finance adjustments that we book as call deposits. These trades are like I've mentioned that they are in the market portfolios, i.e. these are trades that are like the portfolios might also have specifically the finance adjustment.called depots, will have in the same... Actually, no, Bilal. They will be in the same node as the derivative portfolios, but they have their own dedicated portfolios. All right.And then we have this operational call deposit. And these ones are also in a dedicated portfolio, right?Okay, right. And then another thing to note, current run, like, you know, the current runs are like, you know, we have designed them to be run by entity set, right? You've seen those runs, right? The IR buckets will be on the SA entity set, which is effectively all the things that made up the SA node. That's how this was set up, right? I think we have to add more details to these things, right? The more I think about it, so for the guys to have better design ideas.So, just to understand what's being suggested on the proposed design, what we understand is we're going to include... Pass cache now in all the runs, technically, right, per entity set, and then this will allow us to also move to a native PL attribution rather than this reporting-based, you know, stitched-up process, right?And I think, well, you want to say something, Anthony, I don't know.Why do you see the OSIRIS-1 being special to the other ones? I'm just curious to every other thing I have here.Camelian, yeah?Gentlemen.Okay, I don't know if I fully grasped this right. So the way I see this pass-cache problem, right? So let's maybe work through this IBD, right? So currently the attribution. The position state gets imported into Murex. The market value component is taken into account in the attribution process. That comes out of...The position states market value is taken into account. That's been the past cash component of the P&amp;L. It's taken account, it comes from smart trites. And then a combination of those two is what we then try to explain. Or am I?So, so these things are pos... So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Like, because I, let's maybe... Can we just maybe... Let's work through this IBD scenario, right? Let's have a look. Just this loan lives, like, you know, the system it lives in is ACPS. OK, then what do every day I get?I get the position set file from ACBS data importing to MX, right? Importing to MX. Then. But then at the same time, the cash balance corresponding to that portfolio.That comes from smart or chameleon, right?Right. Then the attribution we do, right? So the PL effectively that we form in MX for the position state. I mean, it's not a one-to-one mapping, but you have to look at it on a... If I look at P&amp;L on a portfolio level, I'm just trying to like... That comes market value....of the position set.Right? Position set from ACBS, right?Well, I mean, I'm going to call it PC just using Mirac's terms, right? The cash balance from Chameleon, right? Do I have this formulation right? I mean, I think this is how this works. Right?Then, obviously, we just find the PL difference. This is what our PL attribution is explaining for, like, trades like these, right? So that will happen to the corporate bank side of it and potentially these things at the bottom, right? Now...Yes, yes, yes. The other product is the ones that live in Murex. I think the only difference being this is what we have, right? So, this component is, it's not position state, it's MV from MX, right? This slot is MX. And then passcache from chameleon, right?Yes, yes, yes, yeah, by the way, do we use the market value? But I think technically what we implemented is we take the P&amp;L. Then we minus the MV. Like, do we minus the PC to get the MV, or?Okay, so just so technical implementation, just so, Bilal, you're following here, right? So we're saying we take MXPL. This is what we're doing.This is the current.Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, because FCMX, yeah, that comes from, yeah, okay.OK. So now, what's unique about the societal state? Just so in this, if we frame it.Ask which one. i.e. Yeah.You mean this?So...So, cash in this portfolio is a part of scope, right?I mean, there will be exceptions. I think it's, I mean, we will know that the question is, it's like how much of the exception is there and how painful it is. I think it's always going to be, it's like, you know, it's going to always going to be a function of likeHow much are we changing and how much can we, like, technically, the technical date also cannot just escalate, right? I mean, it's, if we, if we tell people the only, we just have one dedicated run for these things. And that, you know, that deals with like Osiris physicals. I don't think people will be that allergic to it compared to like, we have to split everything. But anyhow, but I think this point stand, like if you had this problem, I still don't think I fully grasp this.This is a voice memo. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. Then that means they implicitly create pass-cache, right? Now, if the current process is not excluding that pass-cache, obviously we're double-counting. So even for like something like IBD, like these loan depots.Agreed.Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.Let's just maybe come back to the side of it and just understand this a bit more. So I think potentially what's, like, this is also a very big fact. Current runs are currently set up by entity sets, right?So now, let's come into what we potentially want to do, right? We want to...Like, we potentially need to split these runs. So I think there's also 90 or so runs for SA, South Africa only, right, for us. Like, just I think we can count those things. We haven't really done it. But let's assume we have X amount of runs for SA. Those things have to be split into two, right? Or is it going to be, you know...A bit less. So, let's look at the primary big runs that we have. I think fx delta is always the tricky one. We have fxDeltaRuns, right, and IRBuckets and IRPars, whatever. I think we should be able to work through this.Like we can work through this logic, right? So if we look at the FX Delta run currently, there's, I think, two or three specifically for the SA entity, right? Some NOFP runs. So now, in the new design, where we include passcache, right? We need to have a run dedicated tothat have past cache included, i.e. these set of traits. That's going to be one run, right? And then we're going to have another run for this, correct?Or actually...Okay, so let's just maybe so so what you're saying is let's talk about the technical design, but I mean, obviously we need to think about this. So we're going to have one run. One reval run. By the way, let's just think about this. This is this lot. This is a sim-based runner. So, I don't know if that makes a difference, but let's just...Some based run and then IR par or like I want to work through both of them. This is a reval run. Are both of them going to be treated the same way? Let's just maybe For the sim-based runs, right, can I just create a subgrouping of that? And let's think about it. So I, for example, like fxDelta, what you're saying is,OK, so let's let's do the rival run the rival run. I mean, I scenario application plus var, right? Scenario, application, plus the var runs, right? So here, we're going to have one run, right? And then, two logical sources. That...And then I guess here, what we're going to do is we're going to do the split, like we're going to do some sort of like smart filtering on the, because we also need to think about the views.I mean, you don't need to answer this. I'm just thinking... So, what's your thinking around? How do we end up with two? So, if we have one... Does this run going to include passcache in it?Yeah, we don't need to do this. We don't need to think about it. But I think the split is important because I think the problem was when we spoke to the guys. I think we just assumption of running this thing into two, just purely like, you know, natively doing it as an even you split the run, you change the scope, et cetera, right? Then the biggest issue just for you have.and understanding of what the pushback is coming from. We have to split every run into two, right? Then that means we have to add 90 new tasks in some sort of controlling. Actually, I haven't even catered for. Yeah, there has to be going to be 90 new tasks in controlling. Then we have to add 90 new merge tasks because we have to merge these things together, right? Because ultimately these downstream reports that are based on the combined source effectively, right?So this is the, you know, let's say, this is, like, yeah, this is the challenge we're going to have. Like, quite a bit of it, actually.And yeah, I mean, we just don't want you to underestimate this component of it. I think in today's session, I just feel like it's just for us to highlight this to. To you guys so that when we get into design, you know, like, you kind of should be ready for these things or preemptively address them.Yeah, I mean, what we're optimizing is minimal. They want to run these things based on entity as well. That's the only thing. Again, but this will be run on an entity level. We're not going to change that, right? We can always just that the scope will be.No, actually, no, no, no, no. That's the, we might have to reconsider that entity-based, entity-set-based design, correct? If we...Okay, then what's the other thing I was going to mention to you was.Yeah. No, I have actually been, like, the thing is, but we can chat about this. For me, like, what if we consider, like, but this is just, like, I think there's holes into this thinking, but which I just noted down as Bilal. It's around, we import the position sets. We generate the cash, past cash balances out of Murex, right? Effectively some sort of report. Then we compare this with the...Cash balance, this is more assumed like this IBD type scenario, right? Then we compare the cash balance that comes from chameleon, right? Because that's the true cash balance. Then generate the difference as an ACF and re-import that thing through TDS back into Murex, right? Then, i.e. even for the position states...In theory, you have the correct cache balance and run everything including passcache but excluding the chameleon position sets. Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure this is going to fall because it's quite an intricate process. But at least I was thinking maybe we don't have to make changes to the risk grounds.As such, or when we make the risk-grant changes, it's one consistent change, which is we include pass-cash everywhere, right? Um, because I'm a big champion of this, to be honest with you. I freak, I hate how RMP thing is set up. Like, you know, this, the PNL attribution process, but I don't know. There's something I've thought about, but I'm like, I need to think, I'll think about it a bit more.Um, to see, you know, because it's a very tiny position. Okay. So think about it, right? So I have a portfolio. Then, I'm going to import the position set into that portfolio. But let's assume there's also a clean portfolio, there's no other pass-cash in there.i.e. the positions, it's an IBD portfolio. Let's work through an IBD portfolio, right? So the positions don't live in mirex. This thing is frozen. Can you guys hear me?Okay, my system's gonna crash, but it's fine, later crash. But I can speak to it. So you have a dedicated portfolio, IBD portfolio, that portfolio fully lives in another, in an external system. Then we get the position set into Murex for the 6th of October, for argument's sake.Then, instantly, when I get the position set into the system, if I go and look at, if I filter on today's position, which effectively the risk engine does, right? The there's going to be cash position that the MV component is MV plus FC component is easy. That's the clean part we like. Then you're going to generate a PC like MX will generate a.Pass cash position right on a portfolio level then what I'm saying we do is we run a report.No, it will not be. That's what I'm saying to you to be incorrect. It will be generated because we just imported like so the whole thing. Wait, sorry, I was trying to type here. So, position state, post states imported as of trade date, right? This implicitly...This implicitly will generate these components. Agreed?There's no guarantee this thing is correct. Let's assume it's incorrect.Incorrect, like incorrect value. Let's assume on a portfolio level, or like on a trade level, it's probably correct, but it's incorrect value on a portfolio level, right? Then what I'm saying is, we run a report to generate PC on post-state trades from today, right?Then we compare this because the true pass-cache position is in chameleon, right?Because this comes as a call account file. Compare this.Was there a report? There's a report. Right? Then we find the diff.We import the diff as corrective poset, right?Then, yeah, I mean, you can use TDS for this. Again, there has to be some script of sort that lives outside some code, some middleware thing that can do this, right? Import the difference as... corrective pause state, then run everything. After that, the position, at least the, like, we don't need to re-import this, right? This chameleon positions, right? We just have used it to.Correct the balance of the past cache. Then run everything, including past cache.i.e. I'm trying to avoid the split. Well now, there has to be a change on all the runs to include pass cache. But now, because the position set... Like the past cash level on a portfolio level for the position state trades is correct. Then we don't have to, you know, do this.Exclude the past cache, yes. That's my thinking, but you know, I don't even know like this OSIRIS process, I'm not close to it. So I have to get into the nitty gritty of it to see. I can, in theory, this could work for. You know, some of these corporate bank and IBD type things, but there's a lot more testing that needs to be done, but that's why I thought maybe it's also worth your time and thinking about this.Yes, right, Bilal? Where is this funding going to be?Like this will be there. I think yes. I think maybe it's also something worth highlighting. Yes, we'll also be gettingOkay, maybe let's just write that out, because I think we did that. Cash in this portfolio is part of the scope. Yeah, this is in MX, in Murex. In Murex.Yeah. No, no, you're right.But for everybody's thing, this is, you know, Cyrus. Yeah, I don't know because the soThe balance, yes, yes, yes. It's two systems. Yes, I think the, yes, you're right. I think the Osiris case is a unique, like unique scenario. The corporate bank and the IBD ones are also, they are aligned in a sense. Cash balance plus the market value all comes from an external system. And then this slot as well, actually, because these call accounts, we...Yeah, they live, the call accounts themselves live in smart or chameleon and the cash balance for them will also come from there, right Bilal?But, I mean, you guys do know, like, what we are optimizing for here. It's actually just the technical team is going to be unhappy if we end up making this a lot. That's, I think, that's the... I guess, yeah, that's the technical data we want to optimize for.Okay. I don't know, Bilal, do you want to add more to this?Yeah, I mean, you can maybe do some funny filtering. Because the scenario applications, I guess, you can... I mean, you can get out the split component, right? Passcache, MV, I don't know, it's been a while since I've looked at the RISC. But, I don't know, it's, yeah, okay. I guess, when is the design session for RISC?What?Oh, that's... oh, that's far. Ah, okay, it's fine. We have enough time to think about things. Okay, cool.All right, I don't know. That's all. I'll share this note with you guys. I'll just put all of this in an email. Just so you guys can read it and then, yeah.I'll just reply to this thing in the chat. Okay, guys, I think that's it then. I think do we need to stay longer, Bilal?Cool, cool, cool.Okay, cheers, bye.]]></description><link>pages/assets/notion-meeting-note-test.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pages/assets/Notion Meeting Note Test.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 12:51:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[RMB Funding Scoping Questionnaire]]></title><link>pages/assets/rmb-funding-scoping-questionnaire.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pages/assets/RMB Funding Scoping Questionnaire.pdf</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 09:08:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[FTP Funding Conceptual Design v0.96 1]]></title><link>pages/assets/ftp-funding-conceptual-design-v0.96-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pages/assets/FTP Funding Conceptual Design v0.96 1.pdf</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 09:25:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Murex Interim Funding Solution v0.3 1]]></title><link>pages/assets/murex-interim-funding-solution-v0.3-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pages/assets/Murex Interim Funding Solution v0.3 1.pdf</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 08:26:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[GTSY Payments  Funding - Business context  July 2025 1]]></title><link>pages/assets/gtsy-payments-funding-business-context-july-2025-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pages/assets/GTSY Payments  Funding - Business context  July 2025 1.pdf</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 08:01:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[GTSY MX Funding BRDv3 1]]></title><link>pages/assets/gtsy-mx-funding-brdv3-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pages/assets/GTSY MX Funding BRDv3 1.pdf</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 06:59:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Group Treasury - Murex Funding Planning Aug 2025  1]]></title><link>pages/assets/group-treasury-murex-funding-planning-aug-2025-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pages/assets/Group Treasury - Murex Funding Planning Aug 2025  1.pdf</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:59:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Murex Funding - Business & Process Impacts June 2025 vs2 1]]></title><link>pages/assets/murex-funding-business-&amp;-process-impacts-june-2025-vs2-1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pages/assets/Murex Funding - Business &amp; Process Impacts June 2025 vs2 1.pdf</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:54:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[RMB.PH3c_Scoping Document]]></title><link>pages/assets/rmb.ph3c_scoping-document.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pages/assets/RMB.PH3c_Scoping Document.pdf</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 14:53:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Organigram]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img alt="Pasted image 20251006111215.png" src="site-lib/media/pasted-image-20251006111215.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self"><br><img alt="Pasted image 20251006111926.png" src="site-lib/media/pasted-image-20251006111926.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self">]]></description><link>organigram.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Organigram.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:20:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
